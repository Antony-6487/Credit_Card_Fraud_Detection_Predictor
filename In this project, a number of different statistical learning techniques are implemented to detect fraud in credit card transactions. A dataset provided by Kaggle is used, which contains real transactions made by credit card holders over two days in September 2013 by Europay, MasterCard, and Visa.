This project explores the application of various statistical learning and machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Using a real-world dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to build and evaluate models that can identify fraud in highly imbalanced data settings.

📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from Kaggle and contains real transactions made by credit card holders over two days in September 2013, provided by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa.
Key characteristics:

284,807 total transactions

492 fraudulent cases (highly imbalanced)

Features are primarily anonymized PCA components (V1, V2, ..., V28)

Includes Time, Amount, and a binary Class indicating fraud (1) or not (0)

🎯 Project Objectives

Explore and clean the transaction dataset

Handle class imbalance using techniques such as:

Oversampling (SMOTE)

Undersampling

Stratified splitting

Apply multiple statistical learning and machine learning models, such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machines

Neural Networks

Compare model performance using metrics appropriate for imbalanced classification:

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC–AUC

Precision–Recall curves

🛠️ Methods and Tools

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, etc.)

📈 Results

The project evaluates how well each model detects fraudulent activity and identifies which techniques work best under severe class imbalance. Visualization and performance comparisons are included.
